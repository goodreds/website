        <p>My genuine focus is to create an authentic connection that empowers and supports the client to achieve their therapeutic goals and improve wellbeing.  My approach is client-led, non-judgemental, curious, and compassionate.  I have a particular interest in trauma and have worked with children, youth and adult survivors of institutional abuse, sexual assault, and domestic and family violence.  I have also engaged with young people who have engaged in problem and harmful sexual behaviours both privately and within the youth justice system.  I am proud to be registered on the Blue Knot Foundation Health Professional Referral Data Base.  I also support Workcover and NDIS clients.</p>
        <p> I work from an integrative therapeutic framework that is trauma sensitive and utilises evidence-based and person-centred therapies. This includes Eye Movement Desensitization Therapy (EMDR), Trauma Informed Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (TF-CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy.</p>
        <p>I welcome all to my practice.</p>
